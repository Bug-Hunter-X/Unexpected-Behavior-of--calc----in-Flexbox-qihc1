To avoid the issues with `calc()` within flexbox, it's often better to use alternative layout strategies. One common approach is to avoid the use of `calc()` entirely, instead making use of the `flex-basis` property along with `flex-grow` for dynamic resizing. Another strategy might be to use grid layout, which provides more direct control over item sizing.

Here's an example of a revised CSS that uses flexbox more effectively avoiding the pitfalls of `calc()` in this context:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.item {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-basis: 0;
  margin: 0 5px;
 /* Alternatively:  width: 50%; */
}
```

This approach uses `flex-grow: 1` to distribute available space equally between items. The `flex-basis: 0` prevents them from occupying any initial space.  Margins are employed for spacing.  In many situations this solution will be preferred to `calc()` within flexbox.
